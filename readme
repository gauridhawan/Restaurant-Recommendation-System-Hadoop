1. We did some more cleaning:
a. Changed all JSONs to TSVs to be read in Impala(Code Attached). Made changes in the same Java Project.
b. Cleaned on the basis of address, as there were many restaurants with the same name but different address, so to match on the address. (Java Mapreduce).

2. Ran analytic code in Impala by creating new tables and joining the 2 datasets and running queries.(Attached file)
